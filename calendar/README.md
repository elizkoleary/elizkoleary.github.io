## Overview
A simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

The app displays standard business hours (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.). Each time slot contains the following:

* The time

* A field to hold user input

* A save button

Clicking on the save button will store the time and user input in `localStorage`.

Near the top of the calendar, the application displays the current day. Additionally, each hour is color coded to reflect whether the time slot is in the past, the present, or the future. This will change depending on the time of day.
 

## Installation

## Usage 

This website provides a simple business day calendar. While the calendar is functional, the true purpose is to demonstrate my knowldege of JavaScript, jQuery, and CDN's.   


## Credits
I used the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time. 

I also used Bootstrap and jQueryfor many of the design elements in this website
