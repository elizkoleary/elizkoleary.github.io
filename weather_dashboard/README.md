## Overview
Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. In this application I built a weather dashboard using the OpenWeather API.

The weather dashboard application finds current weather conditions and the future weather outlook for multiple cities. 

## Installation

This Website was designed for use on Google Chrome. Other browsers may not be fully supported


## Usage 
This application provides a simple weather search for a selected city. While the app works, the true purpose is to demonstrate my knowldege of third party API's

## Credits
I used the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time. 

I also used Bootstrap and jQueryfor many of the design elements in this website.

The third party API being utilized is openweathermap.org
